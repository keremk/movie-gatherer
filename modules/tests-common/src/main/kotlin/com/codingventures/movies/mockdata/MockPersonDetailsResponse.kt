    "biography": "Bong Joon-ho (Korean: 봉준호; born September 14, 1969) is a South Korean filmmaker of international prominence. His films feature social themes, genre-mixing, black humor, and sudden mood shifts. In 2017, Metacritic ranked Bong 13th on its list of the 25 best film directors of the 21st century.\n\nBong first gained recognition for his second feature film, the crime drama \"Memories of Murder\" (2003), before achieving commercial success with his subsequent films, the black comedy monster movie \"The Host\" (2006) and the dystopian thriller \"Snowpiercer\" (2013), both of which are among the highest-grossing films in South Korea.\n\nTwo of his films have screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival — \"Okja\" in 2017 and \"Parasite\" in 2019, the latter of which earned the first Palme d'Or for a South Korean film. For \"Parasite\", Bong received Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay (shared with Han Jin-won), and, on behalf of South Korea, Best International Feature Film.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bong Joon-ho, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
